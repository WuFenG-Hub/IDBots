 * send from the LIVE MetaApp/Skill catalogs, so any catalog change (e.g. a
 * bot publishing a new MetaApp) silently broke the prefix of every running
 * session. This policy keeps the persisted prompt unless the user made a
 * deliberate skill-set change:
 *
 * - no requested prompt                    -> persisted (caller decides)
 * - no persisted prompt                    -> requested (first real prompt)
 * - requested skill set == persisted set   -> persisted: the only possible
 *   byte difference is live-catalog drift, which must never touch the prefix
 * - requested skill set != persisted set   -> requested: a deliberate change
 *   (the runner labels the resulting miss 'system_prompt_changed')
