/**
 * Cerebellum (小脑) volatile block gate — roadmap #3 of the cerebellum system.
 *
 * One JEV request per turn carrying one Noul question per gateable volatile
 * context block ("does this turn need block X?"), all evaluated in parallel
 * against one shared state (the current user message). Blocks whose noul
 * falls below their threshold are omitted from the per-turn user-message
 * tail for THIS turn; everything else injects exactly as before.
 *
 * What this buys: the volatile tail re-sends every CHANGED block on every
 * turn (content-hash dedup only covers byte-stable blocks, and every tail
 * byte is a guaranteed cache miss), and blocks that are irrelevant to the
 * current request dilute the model's attention ("context rot"). Gating
 * trims both per-turn tokens and noise for the occasionally-relevant
 * background blocks. The cacheable system-prompt head is never touched —
 * these blocks live in the tail by design.
 *
 * Gateable blocks (single source for the runner's push sites):
 * - experience:      dream-layer self-identity + daily summaries
 * - twin-impression: distilled impressions of local Worker bots
 * - knowledge-bases: per-bot knowledge base listings
 * - remote-services: on-chain remote service directory
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated: memory (alwaysInject by design), browser and goal
 * (small, live, user-explicit), skills-catalog (the skill shortlist owns
 * that surface).
 *
 * Pure and Electron-free so it is unit-testable in plain Node; the caller
 * injects the fetch implementation. In the app this MUST be
 * session.defaultSession.fetch: the Electron net stack follows the system
 * proxy, while bare Node fetch is region-blocked (HTTP 451) for some users.
 *
 * Failure contract: gateVolatileBlocksWithCerebellum NEVER throws and
 * returns null on HTTP errors, network errors, abort/timeout, malformed
 * payloads, and blank user text — the caller then injects every block
 * exactly as before. Within a usable payload, a missing/unusable per-block
 * answer resolves to true (inject): fail-open per block, never per turn.
