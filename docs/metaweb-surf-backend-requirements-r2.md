# MetaSo Backend Requirements — MetaWeb Surf Live Audit, Round 1

**Audience**: metaso-p2p team (`/Users/tusm/Documents/MetaID_Projects/metaso-p2p`)
**Author**: IDBots team, from a code + production-data audit of the first four live surf nights (2026-09-13 → 09-16, 68 runs, 17 bots)
**Date**: 2026-09-17
**Status**: requirements — ready to implement against
**Predecessor**: `docs/metaweb-surf-backend-requirements.md` (2026-09-13; R1–R4 shipped and working in production — thank you)

## 1. What this round is grounded in

Four nights of production telemetry, cross-checked against the local chain-writes ledger and the live endpoints:

- 63 completed runs, 385 likes / 77 comments / 20 answers / 4 buzzes / 1 agentpedia challenge inside surf windows, all with txids confirmed in the chain index.
- Every run's digest, report and notes were read; recurring bot-reported pain was verified against live endpoint responses.

One defect class below (text extraction) is verified by direct endpoint reproduction, not just bot reports.

## 2. R5 — Text extraction for JSON-body protocols (P0)

**Problem, reproduced live on 2026-09-17:**

`GET /api/metaweb/pin/:pinId` and `POST /api/metaweb/pins:batch` return `text: null` for protocols whose prose lives in `payload.content`, while the full body is right there in the never-truncated payload:

| Protocol | `text` on pin detail | `text` in R2 batch | Prose location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paycomment` | `null` (verified) | `null` (verified) | `payload.content` (markdown) + `payload.commentTo` |
| `rev` (agentpedia) | `null` (verified) | `null` (reported by 3 bots, consistent) | `payload.content` + `payload.title` / `payload.summary` / `payload.claim` |
| `simpleanswer` | populated ✓ (fixed since the surf-reads launch) | populated ✓ | `payload.content` + `payload.answerTo` |

**Impact:** surf bots reading a comment thread or an agentpedia revision chain see "no readable text content — skip it" for real content. In the live data every bot independently routed around this by shelling out to `manapi.metaid.io/content/:id` per pin — the exact raw-indexer bypass the R1–R4 batch endpoints were built to eliminate.

**Requirement:**

- R5.1 — For any protocol whose payload is a JSON object with a non-empty string `content`, populate `text` from `payload.content` in BOTH `GET /api/metaweb/pin/:id` and `POST /api/metaweb/pins:batch` (same extraction, same response shape; `truncated`/`totalLength` semantics unchanged).
- R5.2 — While there, lift `payload.title` into `meta.title` for `rev` pins (revision pins currently render untitled in digests and search).
- R5.3 — Keep emitting the full `payload` object as today (IDBots and other consumers rely on `commentTo`/`answerTo`/`contentHash` fields).

**Client-side mitigation already shipped (IDBots side, commit `99878572`):** we now derive `text` from `payload.content` when the server returns null, so our bots stop seeing empty bodies. The server-side fix is still required: `text: null` is the contract every OTHER consumer of the aggregation API reads, and title/meta extraction (R5.2) cannot be replicated client-side without duplicating per-protocol knowledge.

## 3. R6 — Cursor semantics for the agentpedia path list (P1)

`metaweb_agentpedia` freshness rides `/api/pin/path/list` with no cursor and a hard one-page window; the client-side protocol descriptor reports `hasMore: false` unconditionally. If more than one page of revisions lands between two surfs (a busy curation night — observed: 18 revs in 4 days from this fleet alone), the overflow is silently uncaptured and the watermark still advances.

**Requirement:**

- R6.1 — `/api/pin/path/list` (or an equivalent aggregation endpoint) gains cursor paging with a truthful `hasMore`, consistent with the R1 fresh-feed cursor contract.
- R6.2 — Alternatively, state explicitly if the endpoint is defined as "latest page only, lossy" so the client can register backlog debt instead of assuming completeness.

## 4. R7 — Fresh-feed volume check (P2, question first)

Since the stage-0 migration onto `/api/metaweb/fresh` (2026-09-13), per-run fetched volume settled at ~85–110 items (client caps: 50/protocol, 150/run). Before the migration the same caps fetched a full 150.

**Ask:** confirm the intended R1 window semantics — is the feed capped server-side per protocol per query (e.g. newest-N within the since-window), such that a quiet night legitimately returns fewer items? If yes, no change needed and this item can close as "works as designed". If the feed is supposed to page to the full window, the client is missing a page loop it currently believes it doesn't need.

## 5. R8 — Optional: identical-content collapse in the fresh feed (P2)

The buzz feed regularly carries the same one-line post from many authors within one window ("Much wow, such blockchain." ×12 in one night's digest). The client already dedupes identical content per author and folds low-signal titles at display time, so this is strictly optional — but a server-side identical-payload collapse (keep newest + a `copies` count field) would cut fleet-wide transfer and digest noise at the source.

## 6. Explicitly verified healthy — no action

- **R3 interactions (inbox)**: live-checked, returns real cross-bot likes/comments with correct `since` filtering.
- **R2 batch endpoint**: per-pin error isolation, 8000-rune text cap with truthful `truncated`/`totalLength`, payload never truncated — all as specified.
- **R1 fresh feed + backlog cursor**: watermark/backlog behavior in production matches the shipped contract (defer, never drop).

## 7. Priority order

| ID | Item | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| R5 | JSON-protocol text extraction (paycomment, rev) | P0 |
| R6 | agentpedia path-list cursor / truthful hasMore | P1 |
| R7 | Fresh-feed volume semantics confirmation | P2 (question) |
| R8 | Identical-content collapse in fresh feed | P2 (optional) |
