# Runbook: incident response

First principles: tenants are disposable, volumes are not; the control plane
is stateless except `cp-data`; alerts already told you something — read the
robot message before the dashboards. Always note the time (+08:00) and your
actions for the post-incident note.

## 1. Tenant failed (`TenantFailed`, or a user reports their Bot is dead)

```bash
CP="docker exec idbots-control-plane-1 node dist/cli.js"
$CP tenant show t_xxx            # status, last error, image
$CP tenant logs t_xxx --since 1h # container logs through the Docker API
```

- Image/crash loop → `$CP tenant restart t_xxx`. If it keeps failing, roll
  the tenant back: `$CP tenant upgrade t_xxx --image {previous_image}`
  (see `tenant-image-rollout.md`).
- Volume corruption → restore: `backup-and-restore.md` replace mode.
- Onboarding stuck (gas sponsor down, Metaso down) → the tenant recovers on
  its own once the dependency is back (WS-A REQ-A-8); communicate, don't
  recreate.

## 2. Host memory pressure (`HostMemoryHigh`)

1. `docker stats --no-stream | sort -k4 -h | tail` — find the hogs.
2. A tenant holding > 1.5 GB idle for > 30 min is abnormal (the post-turn
   tail should fall back within 10 min, WS-A REQ-A-31): restart that one
   tenant — user impact is a reconnect.
3. Fleet-wide pressure near capacity: this host is full — start the
   `add-host.md` procedure and stop new provisioning (set the host row's
   capacity to the current tenant count via the control plane).

## 3. Control plane down (`ControlPlaneDown`, 502 at the edge)

Tenants keep serving established sessions; logins/provisioning/proxy stop.

1. `docker logs idbots-control-plane-1 --tail 100`.
2. Bad config/image → `deploy-control-plane.md` § rollback.
3. Healthy but unreachable → check docker-socket-proxy:
   `docker logs idbots-docker-socket-proxy-1 --tail 50`; the control plane
   polls containers through it. Restart order: proxy, then control plane.
4. Still down after 15 min → declare in the robot group, escalate to WS-B.

## 4. SMS provider failure (login codes not arriving)

1. Send a test code through the Alibaba Cloud SMS console — isolates us vs
   them.
2. Check the RAM credential quota/limits in the console; check
   `cp.env` template codes match the approved templates.
3. Provider incident → status page + robot notice; staging can flip
   `CP_SMS_MODE=fake` with allowlisted numbers — PRODUCTION MUST NEVER
   (the control plane refuses fake mode on the production origin, SEC-06).

## 5. Metaso outage (balance/LLM quota/bundle errors in the app)

1. `curl -sI https://www.metaso.network/assist-open-api/health` from the host.
2. Confirmed outage → robot notice: balances and recharge degrade, chat on
   remaining quota continues. Tenants retry on their own.
3. If onboarding stalls (gas sponsor down), new sign-ups wait — do NOT
   recreate tenants; recovery is automatic (§1).

## 6. Suspected compromise (tenant or host)

1. Freeze: stop the affected tenants (`$CP tenant stop t_xxx`), or isolate
   the host in the security group (deny all inbound except your IP) if host
   compromise is suspected.
2. Preserve evidence: `docker logs`, `journalctl -u auditd`, snapshot the
   disk from the console BEFORE changes.
3. Rotate everything that could be exposed, in this order:
   `secret-rotation.md` — gateway secret of affected tenants → CP master key
   → SMS/OSS/ACR RAM credentials → the alert webhook.
4. Rebuild: compromised tenant volumes are treated as hostile — restore the
   user from last night's backup into a fresh volume (replace mode), never
   re-attach the old one.
5. Report: timeline, blast radius (which tenants, what data classes), actions
   — to the owner within 24 h.
